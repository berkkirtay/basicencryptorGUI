Basic encryptor-decryptor implementation with wxwidgets GUI Built by trantor00

I used an algorithm like RSA and added XOR operator applying as well. This algorithm comes with a new basic algorithm implementation which uses 5 keychars to encrypt each character in the given line according to its value with XOR operator. It can be altered to get a harder encryption too. XOR operator is great for encryption because it flips the bits and gives old value after applying 2 times.. Program's handling every character separately(it calculates new character every turn), so, it works a bit slowly if we try handling big files like mp4, zip, iso etc. Of course

It's way too more suitable using with text files(I'd rather say don't use it with anything but text files).

Attention! You must have wxwidgets libs to compile source codes. I included a compiled executable file(windows) and will include for linux as well..
